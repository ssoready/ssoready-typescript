# SSOReady-Typescript

`ssoready` is a Typescript/Node.js SDK for the [SSOReady](https://ssoready.com)
API.

SSOReady is a set of open-source dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You
can use SSOReady to add SAML support to your product this afternoon, for free,
forever. You can think of us as an open source alternative to products like
Auth0 or WorkOS.

## Reference

A full reference of the SDK is available [here](./reference.md).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save ssoready
# or
yarn add ssoready
```

## Usage

For full documentation, check out https://ssoready.com/docs.

At a super high level, all it takes to add SAML to your product is to:

1. Sign up on [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com) for free
2. From your login page, call `getSamlRedirectUrl` when you want a user to sign in with SAML
3. Your user gets redirected back to a callback page you choose, e.g. `your-app.com/ssoready-callback?saml_access_code=...`. You
   call `redeemSamlAccessCode` with the `saml_access_code` and log them in.

Import and construct a SSOReady client like this:

```typescript
import { SSOReadyClient } from 'ssoready';

const ssoready = new SSOReadyClient({
  apiKey: "ssoready_sk_...", // Defaults to process.env.SSOREADY_API_KEY
});
```

Calling the `getSamlRedirectUrl` endpoint looks like this:

```typescript
// this is how you implement a "Sign in with SSO" button
const { redirectUrl } = await ssoready.saml.getSamlRedirectUrl({
  // the ID of the organization/workspace/team (whatever you call it)
  // you want to log the user into
  organizationExternalId: "..."
});

// redirect the user to `redirectUrl`...
```

And using `redeemSamlAccessCode` looks like this:

```typescript
// this goes in your handler for POST /ssoready-callback
const { email, organizationExternalId } = await ssoready.saml.redeemSamlAccessCode({
    samlAccessCode: "saml_access_code_..."
});

// log the user in as `email` inside `organizationExternalId`...
```

Check out [the quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs) for the details spelled
out more concretely. The whole point of SSOReady is to make enterprise SSO super
obvious and easy.

## Request and Response Types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply
import them under the `SSOReady` namespace:

```ts
import { SSOReady } from "ssoready";

const request: SSOReady.RedeemSamlAccessCodeRequest = {
  samlAccessCode: "saml_access_code_..."
};
```

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are more than welcome. Be advised that this library is largely
autogenerated from
[`ssoready/fern-config`](https://github.com/ssoready/fern-config). Most code
changes ultimately need to be made there, not on this repo.
