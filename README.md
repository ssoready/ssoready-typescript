# SSOReady-Typescript

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ssoready)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssoready)

`ssoready` is a Typescript/Node.js SDK for the [SSOReady](https://ssoready.com)
API.

SSOReady is a set of open-source dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You
can use SSOReady to add SAML and SCIM support to your product this afternoon.

For example applications built using SSOReady-TypeScript, check out:

- [SSOReady Example App: Node + TypeScript + Express.js with SAML](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-example-app-node-typescript-express-saml)
- [SSOReady Example App: Next.js + NextAuth](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-example-app-nextjs-nextauth-saml)

## Reference

A full reference of the SDK is available [here](./reference.md).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save ssoready
# or
yarn add ssoready
```

## Usage

This section provides a high-level overview of how SSOReady works, and how it's
possible to implement SAML and SCIM in just an afternoon. For a more thorough
introduction, visit the [SAML
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) or the [SCIM
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/scim/scim-quickstart).

The first thing you'll do is create a SSOReady client instance:

```ts
import { SSOReadyClient } from 'ssoready';

const ssoready = new SSOReadyClient(); // reads api key from env var SSOREADY_API_KEY
```

### SAML in two lines of code

SAML (aka "Enterprise SSO") consists of two steps: an _initiation_ step where
you redirect your users to their corporate identity provider, and a _handling_
step where you log them in once you know who they are.

To initiate logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Get SAML Redirect
URL](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/get-saml-redirect-url)
endpoint:

```ts
// this is how you implement a "Sign in with SSO" button
const { redirectUrl } = await ssoready.saml.getSamlRedirectUrl({
  // the ID of the organization/workspace/team (whatever you call it)
  // you want to log the user into
  organizationExternalId: "..."
});

// redirect the user to `redirectUrl`...
```

You can use whatever your preferred ID is for organizations (you might call them
"workspaces" or "teams") as your `organizationExternalId`. You configure those
IDs inside SSOReady, and SSOReady handles keeping track of that organization's
SAML and SCIM settings.

To handle logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Redeem SAML Access
Code](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code) endpoint:

```ts
// this goes in your handler for POST /ssoready-callback
const { email, organizationExternalId } = await ssoready.saml.redeemSamlAccessCode({
    samlAccessCode: "saml_access_code_..."
});

// log the user in as `email` inside `organizationExternalId`...
```

You configure the URL for your `/ssoready-callback` endpoint in SSOReady.

### SCIM in one line of code

SCIM (aka "Enterprise directory sync") is basically a way for you to get a list
of your customer's employees offline.

To get a customer's employees, you'll use SSOReady's [List SCIM
Users](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/scim/list-scim-users) endpoint:

```ts
const { scimUsers, nextPageToken } = await ssoready.scim.listScimUsers({
  organizationExternalId: "my_custom_external_id"
});

// create users from each scimUser
for (const { email, deleted, attributes } of scimUsers) {
  // ...
}
```

code changes ultimately need to be made there, not on this repo.
